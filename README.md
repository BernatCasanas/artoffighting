# ABOUT THE GAME:

Art of fighting is a fighting video game trilogy that was realsed for 
the Neo Geo platform in the early 1990. Art of fighting follows the 
conventions of the time in the sense that theplayer faces a variety 
of opponents in best two-out-of three matches. Each of the game's 
characters have a unique fighting style and set of special techniques. 
The player has two basic attacks—punch and kick—as well as a utility 
button that switches between punches, kicks, and throws. A fourth button is
used for taunting. Art of Fighting's contribution to the genre was the 
inclusion of a "spirit gauge" underneath the character's life bar. 
When characters perform special techniques, their spirit gauge is depleted
and their special attacks become weaker. Players can also drain their 
opponent's spirit gauge by taunting them.
