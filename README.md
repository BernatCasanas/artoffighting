# ABOUT THE GAME:

Art of fighting is a fighting video game trilogy that was realsed for the Neo Geo platform in the early 1990. Art of fighting follows the conventions of the time in the sense that theplayer faces a variety of opponents in best two-out-of three matches. Each of the game's characters have a unique fighting style and set of special techniques. The player has two basic attacks—punch and kick—as well as a utility button that switches between punches, kicks, and throws. A fourth button is used for taunting. Art of Fighting's contribution to the genre was the inclusion of a "spirit gauge" underneath the character's life bar. When characters perform special techniques, their spirit gauge is depleted and their special attacks become weaker. Players can also drain their opponent's spirit gauge by taunting them.

# HOW TO PLAY:

Two players may simultaneously compete against each other. Each player has 4 keys to move and 3 atack buttons.

Game based on Rounds. The first player to achieve 2 win points win the match.

In the case time runs out, the player with more health amount will be the one to win the round.

If time runs out and the two players have the same health amount the round will be repeated.
